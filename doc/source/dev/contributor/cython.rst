Adding Cython to Musique
======================

As written on the `Cython website`_:

 Cython is an optimising static
 compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended
 Cython programming language (based on Pyrex). It makes writing C
 extensions for Python as easy as Python itself.

If your code currently performs a lot of loops in Python, it might
benefit from compilation with Cython. This document is intended to be a
very brief introduction: just enough to see how to use Cython with
Musique. Once you have your code compiling, you can learn more about how
to optimize it by reviewing the `Cython documentation`_.

There are only two things you need to do in order for Musique compile your
code with Cython:

#. Include your code in a file with a ``.pyx``
   extension rather than a ``.py`` extension. All files with a ``.pyx``
   extension are automatically converted by Cython to ``.c`` or ``.cpp``
   files when Musique is built.

#. Add the new ``.pyx`` file to the ``meson.build`` build configuration
   of the subpackage in which your code lives. Typically, there are already
   other ``.pyx`` patterns present (if not, look in another submodule) so
   there's an example to follow for what exact content to add to
   ``meson.build``.


Example
-------

|linprog-rs|_ contains the implementation of the
revised simplex method for ``musique.optimize.linprog``. The revised
simplex method performs many elementary row operations on matrices, and
so it was a natural candidate to be Cythonized.

Note that ``musique/optimize/_linprog_rs.py`` imports the ``BGLU`` and
``LU`` classes from ``._bglu_dense`` exactly as if they were regular
Python classes. But they’re not. ``BGLU`` and ``LU`` are Cython classes
defined in |bglu-dense|_. There is nothing
about the way they are imported or used that suggests that they are
written in Cython; the only way so far that we can tell they are Cython
classes is that they are defined in a file with a ``.pyx`` extension.

Even in ``/musique/optimize/_bglu_dense.pyx``, most of the code resembles
Python. The most notable differences are the presence of ``cimport``,
``cdef``, and `Cython decorators`_. None of these are strictly
necessary. Without them, the pure Python code can still be compiled by
Cython. The Cython language extensions are \*just\* tweaks to improve
performance. This ``.pyx`` file is automatically converted to a ``.c``
file by Cython when Musique is built.

The only thing left is to add the build configuration, which will look
something like:

.. code:: meson

    _bglu_dense_c = opt_gen.process('_bglu_dense.pyx')

    py3.extension_module('_bglu_dense',
      _bglu_dense_c,
      c_args: cython_c_args,
      dependencies: np_dep,
      link_args: version_link_args,
      install: true,
      subdir: 'musique/optimize'
    )

When Musique is built, ``_bglu_dense.pyx`` will be transpiled by ``cython``
to C code, and then that generated C file is treated by Meson like any other C
code in Musique - producing an extension modules that we will be able to import
and use the ``LU`` and ``BGLU`` classes from.


Exercise
--------

*See a video run-through of this exercise:* \ `Cythonizing Musique Code`_ \

#. Update Cython and create a new branch
   (e.g., ``git checkout -b cython_test``) in which to make some
   experimental changes to Musique

#. Add some simple Python code in a ``.py`` file in the
   ``/musique/optimize`` directory, say ``/musique/optimize/mypython.py``.
   For example:

   ::

      def myfun():
          i = 1
          while i < 10000000:
              i += 1
          return i

#. Let’s see how long this pure-Python loop takes so we can compare the
   performance of Cython. For example, in an IPython console in Spyder:

   ::

      from musique.optimize.mypython import myfun
      %timeit myfun()

   I get something like:

   ::

      715 ms ± 10.7 ms per loop

#. Save your ``.py`` file to a ``.pyx`` file, e.g. \ ``mycython.pyx``.

#. Add the ``.pyx`` to ``musique/optimize/meson.build``, in the way described in
   the previous section.

#. Rebuild Musique. Note that an extension module (a ``.so`` or ``.pyd`` file)
   has been added to the ``build/musique/optimize/`` directory.

#. Time it, e.g. by dropping into IPython with ``spin ipython`` and then:

   ::

      from musique.optimize.mycython import myfun
      %timeit myfun()

   I get something like:

   ::

      359 ms ± 6.98 ms per loop

   Cython sped up the pure Python code by a factor of ~2.

#.  That’s not much of an improvement in the scheme of things. To see
    why, it helps to have Cython create an “annotated” version of our
    code to show bottlenecks. In a terminal window, call Cython on your
    ``.pyx`` file with the ``-a`` flag:

    ::

       cython -a musique/optimize/mycython.pyx

    Note that this creates a new ``.html`` file in the
    ``/musique/optimize`` directory. Open the ``.html`` file in any
    browser.

#.  The yellow-highlighted lines in the file indicate potential
    interaction between the compiled code and Python, which slows things
    down considerably. The intensity of the highlighting indicates the
    estimated severity of the interaction. In this case, much of the
    interaction can be avoided if we define the variable ``i`` as an
    integer so that Cython doesn’t have to consider the possibility of
    it being a general Python object:

    ::

       def myfun():
           cdef int i = 1  # our first line of Cython code
           while i < 10000000:
               i += 1
           return i

    Recreating the annotated ``.html`` file shows that most of the
    Python interaction has disappeared.

#. Rebuild Musique, open an fresh IPython console, and ``%timeit``:

::

   from musique.optimize.mycython import myfun
   %timeit myfun()

I get something like: ``68.6 ns ± 1.95 ns per loop``. The Cython code ran
about 10 million times faster than the original Python code.

In this case, the compiler probably optimized away the loop, simply
returning the final result. This sort of speedup is not typical for real
code, but this exercise certainly illustrates the power of Cython when
the alternative is many low-level operations in Python.
