Musique is built to work with
NumPy arrays, and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines,
such as routines for numerical integration and optimization. Together, they
run on all popular operating systems, are quick to install, and are free of
charge. NumPy and Musique are easy to use, but powerful enough to be depended
upon by some of the world's leading scientists and engineers. If you need to
manipulate numbers on a computer and display or publish the results, give
Musique a try!

For the installation instructions, see `our install
guide <https://musique.org/install/>`__.
